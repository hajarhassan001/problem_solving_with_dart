// Syntax of Abstract Method ?
// Why We Need Abstract Class?

/*create example there is an abstract class Vehicle with two abstract methods start() and stop().
 The subclasses Car and Bike implement the abstract methods and override them to print the message.*/

// Syntax of Interface In Dart ?

/* create example: there is an interface Laptop with two methods turnOn() and turnOff().
// The class MacBook implements the interface and overrides the methods to print the message.*/
// synatx of Multiple Inheritance In Dart ?

/* create example: two abstract classes are named Area and Perimeter. 
The Area class has an abstract method area() and the Perimeter class has an abstract method perimeter(). 
The Shape class implements both the Area and Perimeter classes. 
The Shape class has to implement the area() and perimeter() methods.*/

// waht are Mixin In Dart ?
// what is the Rules For Mixin ?
// Syntax of MIXIN ?

/*create example: there are two mixins named CanFly and CanWalk. 
The CanFly mixin has a method fly() and the CanWalk mixin has a method walk().
The Bird class uses both the CanFly and CanWalk mixins. The Human class uses the CanWalk mixin.*/

// Syntax Of On Keyword ?

/*create example: there is abstract class named Animal with properties name and speed.
 The Animal class has an abstract method run(). The CanRun mixin is only used by class that extends Animal.
 The Dog class extends the Animal class and uses the CanRun mixin. 
The Bird class cannot use the CanRun mixin because it does not extend the Animal class.*/

// waht is Factory Constructor In Dart ?
// Syntax of Factory Constructor In Dart ?

/* create example: factory constructor is used to validate the input.
 If the input is valid, it will return a new class instance. If the input is invalid, 
then it will throw an exception.*/

/* create example there is a class named Person with two properties, firstName and lastName,
 and two constructors, a normal constructor and a factory constructor.
 The factory constructor creates a Person object from a Map.*/




 
// what is Polymorphism in dart ?
// Syntax of Polymorphism ?

/* create Example on Polymorphism By Method Overriding In Dart In this example below,
 there is a class named Animal with a method named eat().
  The eat() method is overridden in the child class named Dog.*/

// what will happen if you don't write @override ?

/*create example : there is a class named Employee with a method named salary().
 The salary() method is overridden in two child classes named Manager and Developer.*/
