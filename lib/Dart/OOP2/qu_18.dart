// Types Of Inheritance In Dart
/*
1- Single Inheritance - In this type of inheritance, a class can inherit from only one class.
 In Dart, we can only extend one class at a time.

2- Multilevel Inheritance - In this type of inheritance,
 a class can inherit from another class and that class can also inherit from another class. In Dart,
 we can extend a class from another class which is already extended from another class.

3- Hierarchical Inheritance - In this type of inheritance, parent class is inherited by multiple subclasses.
 For example, the Car class can be inherited by the Toyota class and Honda class.

4- Multiple Inheritance - In this type of inheritance, a class can inherit from multiple classes.
 Dart does not support multiple inheritance. For e.g. Class Toyota extends Car, Vehicle {} is not allowed in Dart. */
