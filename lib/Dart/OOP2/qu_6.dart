// what is Getter In Dart ?


//Setters and getters are methods used to access and modify the values of class properties.
// They provide a level of abstraction, enabling developers to encapsulate internal data and control access to it.
// Setters are used to modify property values, while getters are used to retrieve property values.

/*Getter is used to get the value of a property. 
It is mostly used to access a private propertyâ€™s value. Getter provide explicit read access to an object properties.


- t is used to retrieve a particular class field and save it in a variable. 
All classes have a default getter method but it can be overridden explicitly.
 The getter method can be defined using the get keyword as:

return_type get field_name{
    ...
}
